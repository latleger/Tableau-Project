# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
I choose Option 2 and choose to use the FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015 database. 

My goal is to examine the effects of Wildlife Strikes. What type of wildlife has the most strikes, the effect of damages with regards to cost and severity.  

## Process
1. Review the date. See, if I needed to do any additional cleaning of the data. 

2. I created visualizations for some of the data, so I can find relationships or outliers which required deeper analysis. 

3. I thought of questions which I could answer for the data and visualizations: 
	- Which wildlife attributes to the largest number of strikes? 
	- Which months and where are the most occurrences?
	- What time of day do strikes happen most often? What is the amount spent on damage and the severity of damage?
	- Does the number of strikes correlate with the cost of damage by the airport? 

4. Upon reviewing the data, outliers emerged, particularly the significant increase in damage costs in 2009. The severity of the increase was found to be higher, with two planes destroyed and several substantial damages occurring simultaneously in 2009.

5. I also created a forecast on the number of strikes and the cost of damages. This will be the forecast if the airport and airlines do not improve on preventative measures. 

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

I choose Option 2 and the FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015 database.

I choose the 4 questions and reviewed 1 outlier: 

My questions: 
	- Which wildlife attributes to the largest number of strikes? 
	- Which months and where are the most occurrences?
	- What time of day do strikes happen most often? What is the amount spent on damage and the severity of damage?
	- Does the number of strikes correlate with the cost of damage by the airport? 

My outlier: 
	- The significant increase in damage costs on damages in 2009

I reviewed the data several times and created several different visualizations to find the answers I need to answer the questions I add regarding the data. 


## Challenges 
My biggest challenge was there was not enough information in the database. Also, I was unsure of how dependable the data was, as it noted that the Canada Goose is a migratory bird, however, it also noted that it does not have a fall migration schedule. As a Canadian, I know they definitely migrate in the fall, as it is a sign the summer is ending. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would have looked into a couple of the other outliers I had found in the database. I would have also, tried to look for a more complete dataset to work with.
